### Corburt Map Editor

This is a tiny tool made with [Ascede](https://github.com/EinNeuerBenutzername/Ascede).

#### Version History

##### v1

- Camera module implemented.
- What CBME is capable of:
  - Initialize map data.
  - Create new rooms and create/remove entrances.
  - Delete rooms.
  - Edit room name and description.
  - Save map data to `export.txt`.

##### v2

- Modules revised.
- Can read map data.

##### v3

- Camera module revised.
- Map data reading revised and stabilized.
- New mapping functions:
  - Highlight abnormal room exits data.
  - Tint rooms with enemies red.

##### v3+

- Made visual improvements and improved data stability.

##### v3++

- Made slight visual improvements.
- Can now edit room type and region, and is now with different tint for rooms in different regions.
- Camera module slightly revised to make even smaller scaling available.
- Sadly, the seemingly randomly-occuring bug of the misterious disappearing of one side of the connections between rooms is still not fixed :P
